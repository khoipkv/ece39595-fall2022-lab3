(a) Agile:
    Pros: The project moves faster, is easier to adapt, releases producst as often as possible, and can respond to clients much faster
    Cons: Unpredictable, can deliver a final product that it different from the initial plan

Non-agile
    Pros: Predictable, have a concrete plan right from the start
    Cons: Slower, if one step stops, all the following step will be on hold -> bottleneck

(b) Scrum master:
    - Plan and execute the Agile Methodology with the Scrum development team
    - Work with the Product Owner to make sure the product backlog is up to date
    
    Product Owner:
    - Create and maintain product backlog
    - Work with the Scrum Master to ensure the product's development aligns with its original vision
