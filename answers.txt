(a) Agile:
    Pros: The project moves faster, is easier to adapt, releases producst as often as possible, and can respond to clients much faster
    Cons: Unpredictable, can deliver a final product that it different from the initial plan

Non-agile
    Pros: Predictable, have a concrete plan right from the start
    Cons: Slower, if one step stops, all the following step will be on hold -> bottleneck
